# EBOLA-VENSIM-System-Dynamics-Models

This paper models the EBOLA virus epidemic in West African regions. The model can be used for similar type of epidemic modeling and can be a useful tool for COVID-19 prediction model development. The system dynamics model in VENSIM software is given here along with the paper. If you find it useful for epedemic modeling, please cite:
